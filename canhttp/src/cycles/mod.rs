//! Middleware to handle cycles accounting.
//!
//! Issuing HTTPs outcalls requires cycles, and this layer takes care of the following:
//! 1. Calculate the number of cycles required.
//! 2. Decide how the canister should charge for those cycles.
//! 3. Do the actual charging.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! To let the canister pay for HTTPs outcalls with its own cycle:
//! ```rust
//! use canhttp::{cycles::{ChargeMyself, CyclesAccountingServiceBuilder}, Client};
//! use tower::{Service, ServiceBuilder, ServiceExt, BoxError};
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let mut service = ServiceBuilder::new()
//!   .cycles_accounting(ChargeMyself::default())
//!   .service(Client::new_with_box_error());
//!
//! let _ = service.ready().await.unwrap();
//!
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! To charge the caller of the canister for the whole cost of the HTTPs outcall with an additional fixed fee of 1M cycles:
//! ```rust
//! use canhttp::{cycles::{ChargeCaller, CyclesAccountingServiceBuilder}, Client};
//! use tower::{Service, ServiceBuilder, ServiceExt, BoxError};
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let mut service = ServiceBuilder::new()
//!   .cycles_accounting(ChargeCaller::new(|_request, cost| cost + 1_000_000))
//!   .service(Client::new_with_box_error());
//!
//! let _ = service.ready().await.unwrap();
//!
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
