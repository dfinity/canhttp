## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added
- **Breaking:** A new method `charge_cycles` that does the actual charging was added to `CyclesChargingPolicy` ([#7](https://github.com/dfinity/canhttp/pull/7))
- Example of canister using the library to make HTTP requests ([#6](https://github.com/dfinity/canhttp/pull/6))

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Update `ic-cdk` to `v0.18.7` including several changes to align with the new HTTP outcall API ([#21](https://github.com/dfinity/canhttp/pull/21)). Notably:
  - `IcError` is refactored into an enum
  - Use of the new `HttpRequestArgs` and `HttpRequestResult` types in `CyclesChargingPolicy` and `Client` trait impls
  - Removal of `IcHttpRequestWithCycles`, `CyclesCostEstimator`, `CyclesAccountingError` and `CyclesAccounting` due to the `ic-cdk` method for making HTTP outcalls now taking care of charging cycles
